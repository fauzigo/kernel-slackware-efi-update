# kernel-slackware-efi-update
kernel update script for slackware 

## get it and compile it
kernelCompiler.sh would download and compile, it may require some manual intervention if the new kernel has new features that you current kernel doesn't. I use huge kernels, therefore I name them that way. 

Also my computer uses EFI, so no need to run lilo everytime.

This script shouldn't screw up any active slackware installation, but it might.

Common sense if you download it and use it.

## switch 
switchKernel.sh would make a switch between current kernel and the version you tell it to.
